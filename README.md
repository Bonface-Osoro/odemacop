# object detection methods on air-based collection platforms(odemacop)

Connecting the other 45% of the unconnected world population living in areas with no form of coverage will require the use of spacebourne technologies. Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites are fronted as an alternative due to relatively low cost of production and lower latency. However, placing the thousands of satellites in orbit required to provide global coverage will need several single event launch missions. `Figure 1` illustrates the configuration of the LEO satellite orbits for the constellations assessed in this study.
